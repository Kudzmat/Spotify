# Spotify
A Spotify app created in Python using Spotify's Python API - "Spotipy"

To use this app you will need to have a spotify account as well as a spotify developers account to get your client id and client secret.
For security purposes I unfortunately had to remove my credentials.

- The app allows you to search for an artist by name.
- Searching for an artist then gives you the option to either view the artist's album information or their top 10 songs on Spotify.
- You can also search for an album using either the name of the album, or the album's id (spotify specific).
- To get the album ID you must search for the artist and view their album information
- After finding the album you are looking for, you can enjoy some streaming goodness!
